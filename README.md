# Java Tutorial for Beginners
### *Telusko*

## Introduction

As my Java skills were very basic, I was looking for a course that can be taken online, that covers basic
(and a bit advanced) information, and that I can take it in small portions.
I found this course on Youtube which has 168 videos (!) but most of them are less than 10 minutes long. I admit that
initially, it looked a little silly to me, but remember it is for beginners. He sometimes makes mistakes but fixes
them, a good way to learn some troubleshooting skills, and donâ€™t try to imitate his terrible code-style.

Other than these the course covers the terms and structure of the language, its evolution (like how enums were added,
or when default method definitions were introduced for interfaces). It highlights the new features of Java 8 vs older 
versions. It breaks more involved concepts like streams and lambda expressions to simpler blocks so it becomes more
understandable.
The bottom line, I recommend browsing through this playlist. I figure most of you will be able to skip large portions
of it and get to specifics you want to learn or refresh your knowledge.
